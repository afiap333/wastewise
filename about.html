        <h1>About WasteWise</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            We created WasteWise to draw attention to the problem of 
            overconsumption in the United States, and specifically the issue of fast 
            fashion. We hope that by raising awareness, 
            we can empower people to make more sustainable choices. As Gen Z-ers, we
            have the opportunity to shape the future to be more eco-friendly. We believe
            that everyone has the responsibility to do what they can to take care 
            of our planet and ensure its safety for future generations.
        </p>

            This Give Back Project was created as part of the Girls Who Code Leadership Academy.
            We were part of Group 5, focusing on Game Development. We are grateful for the opportunity
            to develop our technical skills while creating a project that raises awareness about
            critical environmental sustainability issues. Thank you to the GWC team!
