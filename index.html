        <h3>What is overconsumption?</h3>
        <p id="info">Overconsumption, the practice of consuming resources faster than they can regenerate, is a significant and growing threat to the environment and global health. Humanity currently uses the planet's resources at a rate 1.7 times faster than they can be replenished, a stark increase from 1961 when we required only 0.74 Earths. This rise is driven by population growth and increasing per-capita consumption, especially in wealthier regions where 20% of the population consumes 80% of global resources.
            
            <br><br>Food production, particularly meat consumption, plays a major role, with much of the food extracted being wastedâ€”up to one-third globally. Overfishing, deforestation, and the extraction of other natural resources like oil and copper are also leading to environmental degradation, pollution, and serious health consequences, such as those seen in the Niger Delta and the Amazon.
            
            <br><br>The long-term effects of overconsumption include dwindling resources, polluted oceans, and a projected tripling of deaths due to air pollution by 2050. Solutions to combat overconsumption include reducing overall consumption, switching to reusable products, adopting plant-based diets, and spending less money in general. Critics argue that while green technology is important, reducing consumption across the board is a more effective strategy for protecting the environment.
