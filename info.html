                    Overconsumption, the practice of consuming resources faster than they can regenerate, is a significant and growing threat to the environment and global health. Humanity currently uses the planet's resources at a rate 1.7 times faster than they can be replenished, a stark increase from 1961 when we required only 0.74 Earths. This rise is driven by population growth and increasing per-capita consumption, especially in wealthier regions where 20% of the population consumes 80% of global resources.

                   Children are the most highly impacted by overconsumption. UNICEF finds that countries that are providing healthy environments for children 
                   at home destroys children's environments abroad. Finland, Iceland and Norway rank in the top one-third
                   for providing a healthy environment for their children but rank in the bottom third for the world with rates of emissions, e-waste and consumption. 
                   Additonally, it is children who will be living in the world in the future, yet the environment is highly impacted by overconsumption.
