                    Overconsumption, the practice of consuming resources faster than they can regenerate, is a significant and growing threat to the environment and global health. Humanity currently uses the planet's resources at a rate 1.7 times faster than they can be replenished, a stark increase from 1961 when we required only 0.74 Earths. This rise is driven by population growth and increasing per-capita consumption, especially in wealthier regions where 20% of the population consumes 80% of global resources.

                   Children are the most highly impacted by overconsumption. UNICEF finds that countries that are providing healthy environments for children 
                   at home destroys children's environments abroad. Finland, Iceland and Norway rank in the top one-third
                   for providing a healthy environment for their children but rank in the bottom third for the world with rates of emissions, e-waste and consumption. 
                   Additonally, it is children who will be living in the world in the future, yet the environment is highly impacted by overconsumption.

                        The number of clothes the average consumer purchased from 2000 to 2014 increased by 60% but clohtes are only kept half as long.
                        This is partially due to the use of polyester and the lower quality of the materials. Synthetic materials also negatively 
                        impact the environment. In addition to the fabrics used, fast fashion has become a trend. Companies create hundreds of new designs daily,
                        and with cheaper quality and fast moving trends, people buy into their designs.

                        While technology has the capability to positively impact the environment, such as the use of AI to
                        improve sustainable practices, the consumption and purchasing of technology can negatively impact the environment. 
                        Instead of repairing or keeping older phones, people are often purchasing the newest model as soon as possible. 
                        Tech companies do not help with this, as they release new models every year. In addition, the mining 
                        of minerals for phones, such as the iPhone, can negatively impact those who live in mining areas.

                        Approximately 133 billion pounds of waste are generated by the U.S. each year. The food industries impact on
                        overconsumption is both due to consumer spending as well as company production habits. We have a tendency to buy more 
                        food than we eat, and any perishable items are thrown away. Overproduction in the food industry is common, 
                        with more fod prepared than is sold and excess food goes to late.

                    According to U.S. Bancorp, Americans experiences a 13% increase in consumer sentiment in January 2024 alone.
                    Social media trends and influences contribute to overconsumption due to the constant advertisement and pushing of 
                    products to the screens of the world, especially young adults. Tiktok, Instagram and more create the perception
                    of the influencer life, and the need for all the same items. Additionally, the Tiktok shop advertises items for cheap,
                    again promoting the purchase of uneccessary products. New trends such as "de-influencing", explaining why you don't need an item,
                    has arisen.
